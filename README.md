For now feel free to read the following overview of the CSS 2025 below.

# Overview
- We have 30 research institutes in South Africa who will be part of the school as well as universities from neighbouring countries.
- We have over 800 postgraduate students and professionals who will taking part.
The Coding Summer School (CSS) is jointly organised by the Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) of the CSIR and the National Institute for Theoretical Computational Science (NITheCS). This joint effort was specifically motivated by a concept paper of the South African Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) that explores the possibility to broaden the scope of NITheP into a national institute/centre for theoretical and computational science. This is the 15th year an event of this kind has happened through the CHPC and 7th year in collaboration with NITheCS

**We are all excited for you to join this landmark summer school!**
